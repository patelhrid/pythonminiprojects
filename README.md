# pythonminiprojects

This is simply some Python exercises that I found on the internet, and are just an extension of my Python knowledge that I learnt myself. The exercises are fairly simple yet testing of the coding language, and consist of tasks like the quadratic formula and more. I began teaching myself Python in the summer following my grade 10 school year, and have followed up on it here and there in my free time, and has allowed me to understand the art of coding. I decided to upload it to GitHub after creating my account this year.
