# pythonminiprojects

These are simply some Python exercises that I have done from the internet, and are just an elaboration of my Python knowledge that I learnt myself. The exercises are fairly simple yet testing of the coding language, and consist of tasks like the quadratic formula and more. I began teaching myself Python in the summer following my grade 10 school year as an extension to the ICS3U course. I have followed up on it here and there in my free time, and it has allowed me to understand the art of coding. I decided to upload it to GitHub after creating my account this year.
